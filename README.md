===========

Repository for the 3rd class of the Data Science Specialization

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

To start working, the first thing we need to do is download the source files from the provided url, then unzip the next 
files to the working directory:
subject_train.txt
X_train.txt
y_train.txt
subject_test.txt
X_test.txt
y_test.txt
features.txt and 
activity_labels.txt

After donwload and unzip the files we must do this steps:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

All this steps were made in the run_analysis.R file, follow each one to complete the project purpose.
